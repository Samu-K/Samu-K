**Who am I?**

Hello, my name is Samu Kaarlela. I'm currently a high school student in Finland, Alaj√§rvi. 
My main hobbies aside from programming are boxing, working out, playing music and playing some video games.

I got interested in data science, which drew my attention due to the possibility of having an impact on the world, 
about 3 years ago and have been self-teaching the area since then.

My main interes right now is computer vision.
