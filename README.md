**Who am I?**

Hello, my name is Samu Kaarlela. I'm currently a senior-high student in Finland, Alaj√§rvi. 
My main hobbies aside from programming are boxing, working out, playing music and playing some video games.

**My interests:**

I got interested in data science about 3 years ago and have been self-teaching the area since then.
Before data science I was learning python for general use and video game programming, 
but data science drew my attention due to the possibility of having an impact on the world.

**Current projects:**

Right now I don't have a big project going on as I'm quite busy in my day to day life.
I am startion to get more into cloud computing and improving my pipelines and product development (Any resources would be hugely appreciated)

**Where I can be reached?**

I'm most active on Stack, Kaggle and LinkedIn. I'm probably going to increase my presence on Twitter too, but LinkedIn is the best bet right now.
